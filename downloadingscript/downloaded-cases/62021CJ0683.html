In addition, recitals 11 and 129 of the GDPR emphasise the need to ensure, for the purpose of guaranteeing the consistent application of that regulation, that the supervisory authorities have equivalent powers for monitoring and ensuring compliance with the rules for the protection of personal data and that they can impose equivalent sanctions in the event of infringements of that regulation.</p>

Through their dissuasive effect, administrative fines contribute to strengthening the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and are therefore a key element in ensuring respect for the rights of those persons, in accordance with the purpose of that regulation, which is to ensure a high level of protection for such persons with regard to the processing of personal data.</p>

Having regard to the fact that the GDPR aims to achieve a level of protection which is both equivalent and homogenous, and that, to that end, it must be applied consistently throughout the Union, it would be contrary to that purpose to allow the Member States to lay down such a regime for imposing a fine pursuant to Article 83 of that regulation. Moreover, such freedom of choice would be liable to distort competition between economic operators within the Union, which would run counter to the objectives set out by the EU legislature in, inter alia, recitals 9 and 13 of that regulation.</p>
