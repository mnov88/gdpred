In support of that request, she claimed that she had suffered non-material damage as a result of a personal data breach, within the meaning of Article 4(12) of the GDPR, more specifically, a breach of security caused by the NAP’s failure to fulfil its obligations under, inter alia, Article 5(1)(f) and Articles 24 and 32 of that regulation.

Furthermore, according to the NAP, there was no causal link between the alleged non-material damage and that breach.

That assessment must be carried out in a concrete manner, taking into account the likelihood of the risks identified and their severity.

It is apparent from that illustrative list of types of ‘damage’ that may be suffered by the data subjects that the EU legislature intended to include in those concepts, in particular, the mere ‘loss of control’ over their own data, as a result of an infringement of that regulation, even if there had been no misuse of the data in question to the detriment of those data subjects.</p>
