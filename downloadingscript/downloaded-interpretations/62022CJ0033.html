The material scope of the GDPR, as defined in Article 2(1) thereof, is conceived in exhaustive terms and concerns all data processing, irrespective of the entity which carries out the processing and the State function to which that entity belongs. Nor, moreover, can an exception to the applicability of the GDPR be inferred from Article 2(2) thereof, as regards certain State functions, such as the legislative function, since the exception provided for in point (a) of that provision is to be interpreted restrictively.
