It considers that the principle of ‘purpose limitation’, as set out in Article 5(1)(b) of Regulation 2016/679, does not enable it to determine the internal systems in which the controller is entitled to process the lawfully collected data or to ascertain whether the controller may copy those data to a test database without changing the purpose of the initial data collection.</p>

Consequently, where the questions referred concern the interpretation or the validity of a rule of EU law, the Court is in principle bound to give a ruling. It follows that questions referred by national courts enjoy a presumption of relevance. The Court may refuse to rule on a question referred by a national court only where it appears that the interpretation sought bears no relation to the actual facts of the main action or its object, where the problem is hypothetical, or where the Court does not have before it the factual or legal material necessary to give a useful answer to the questions submitted to it (judgment of 16 July 2020, Facebook Ireland and Schrems, <a href="./../../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2020%3A559&locale=en"

The questions referred relate precisely to the interpretation of those provisions, with the result that it cannot be found that the interpretation sought of EU law bears no relation to the actual facts of the main action or to its object or is hypothetical. Moreover, the order for reference contains sufficient factual and legal material to give a useful answer to the questions submitted by the referring court.</p>

As the Advocate General noted in point 60 of his Opinion, such processing does not deviate from the legitimate expectations of those customers as to the subsequent use of their personal data. It is not, furthermore, apparent from the order for reference that those data were sensitive in whole or in part or that the further processing at issue of those data, as such, had detrimental consequences for the subscribers or was not accompanied by appropriate safeguards, which it is, in any event, for the referring court to verify.</p>
