            <p class="coj-normal">As regards, in the first place, the wording of the provision at issue, it should be noted that, as set out in the second sentence of Article 38(6) of the GDPR, ‘the [DPO] may fulfil other tasks and duties.

            <p class="coj-normal">It thus follows from the wording of that provision, first, that the GDPR does not establish that there is a fundamental incompatibility between, on the one hand, the performance of DPO’s duties and, on the other hand, the performance of other duties within the controller or processor. Article 38(6) of that regulation specifically provides that the DPO may be entrusted with performing tasks and duties other than those for which it is responsible under Article 39 of the GDPR.</p>

In the light of the meaning of those words in everyday language, it must be held that, in accordance with the objective pursued by Article 38(6) of the GDPR, the DPO cannot be entrusted with performing tasks or duties which could impair the execution of the functions performed by the DPO.</p>
