That right also applies in relation to limited partnerships with only indirect shareholdings. The knowledge of all other partners, including those with indirect shareholdings, is necessary to make effective use of the rights held by each partner in a partnership offering shares for public subscription. Disclosure of those personal data to other partners is therefore in keeping with the obligations which are incumbent on the partnership pursuant to the contract under which it is established. The only exception to the right of obtaining such data under German law consists in the prohibition of an abuse of rights, which prohibits the right to information from being exercised unlawfully or with harmful intent.</p>

Moreover, there is no reason to refuse to provide information on the ground that there is a purely abstract risk of misuse of those personal data. In addition, a partner must be able to access the data of the other partners of the partnership directly, without depending on that partnership’s managing bodies.</p>

That court further states that there is no legal obligation under German law to publish the data concerning persons with shareholdings in a trust company. Thus, the referring court asks whether a right of access to partners’ data should not be subject, first, to a certain shareholding threshold, by analogy to what is provided for in German law in respect of listed public limited companies and, second, to a specific and precise reason, linked to the partnership, concerning the partners in respect of whom such information is requested.</p>
