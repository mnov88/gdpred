Deutsche Post considers that the situation of its wage-earning employees with respect to income tax does not assist an assessment of whether serious or repeated infringements of customs legislation or of tax rules, or serious criminal offences, have been committed in the context of its economic activity. According to Deutsche Post, the collection of tax identification numbers is neither necessary nor appropriate for the purpose of determining its reliability in term of customs law, and the verification of the individual tax situation of all the individuals affected is disproportionate in relation to that objective.</p>

Its main argument is that the transmission of the tax identification numbers is necessary to ensure unmistakeable identification of the persons concerned in a request for information that it might submit to the responsible tax office, that an exchange of information is provided for, on a case-by-case basis, only if that office is in possession of evidence of serious and repeated infringements of the tax legislation, no account being taken of administrative procedures leading to fines or criminal prosecutions that are abandoned, and that repeated infringements of the tax legislation are taken into account only when their frequency is disproportionate in relation to the nature and size of the commercial activity of the applicant for authorisation. The Hauptzollamt considers that the group of individuals affected by the questions raised is compatible with the EU customs legislation.</p>

Consequently, it is important that, before that status is granted, those authorities can obtain information on the reliability of the applicant for that status with regard to compliance with the customs legislation and on the reliability of the natural persons mentioned in the second subparagraph of Article 24(1) of Implementing Regulation 2015/2447 with regard to their compliance with the customs legislation and the tax rules applicable to them.</p>
