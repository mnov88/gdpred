Since that date and by virtue of the ‘one-stop shop’ rule, it appears that, in accordance with Article 56 of Regulation 2016/679, only the Data Protection Commissioner (Ireland) is competent, subject to review only by the Irish courts.</p>

It is clear, in particular, from Article 51(1) of Regulation 2016/679 that the supervisory authorities are responsible for monitoring the application of that regulation, for the purpose, inter alia, of protecting the fundamental rights of natural persons as regards the processing of their personal data. It follows that, in line with what has been said in paragraph 45 of the present judgment, the rules on the allocation of competences to adopt decisions between the lead supervisory authority and the other supervisory authorities, as laid down by that regulation, take nothing away from the responsibility incumbent on each of those authorities to contribute to a high level of protection of those rights, with due regard to those rules and to the requirements of cooperation and mutual assistance mentioned in paragraph 52 of the present judgment.</p>

In that situation, under Article 61(8) of that regulation, the supervisory authority concerned may adopt a provisional measure on the territory of its own Member State and, if it considers that there is an urgent need for the adoption of final measures, that authority may, in accordance with Article 66(2) of that regulation, request an urgent opinion or an urgent binding decision from the European Data Protection Board.

It is otherwise, subject to the principle of the non‑retroactivity of legal acts, only if the new rule is accompanied by special provisions which specifically lay down its conditions of temporal application.
