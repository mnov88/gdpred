Differences in the level of protection of the rights and freedoms of natural persons, in particular the right to the protection of personal data, with regard to the processing of personal data in the Member States may prevent the free flow of personal data throughout the Union. Those differences may therefore constitute an obstacle to the pursuit of economic activities at the level of the Union, distort competition and impede authorities in the discharge of their responsibilities under Union law. Such a difference in levels of protection is due to the existence of differences in the implementation and application of Directive [95/46].</p>

The consequence of that use is that the user accepts the general terms and conditions of the application and its data protection policy.

First, the application of Article 80(1) of the GDPR presupposes that the data subject has mandated the not-for-profit body, organisation or association referred to in that provision to take on his or her behalf the legal measures provided for in Articles 77 to 79 of the GDPR. It is common ground that that is not the case in the main proceedings, since the Federal Union acts independently of any mandate from a data subject. Second, it is common ground that Article 84 of the GDPR concerns the administrative and criminal penalties applicable to infringements of that regulation, which is also not at issue in the main proceedings.</p>
