            <p class="coj-normal">The applicants in the main proceedings lodged an appeal against that judgment before the Oberlandesgericht Köln (Higher Regional Court, Cologne, Germany). That appeal was dismissed by judgment of 8 November 2018. That court stated that the specific method of functioning of a search engine and the particular importance it has for the functioning of the internet must be accorded particular importance in the context of the weighing-up of competing rights and interests which is to be undertaken. Given that the operator of the search engine generally has no legal relationship with those providing the content shown, and given that it is impossible for that operator to investigate the facts and assess them while also taking account of the opinions of those providers, the operator of the search engine is subject to specific obligations to act only when it becomes aware, following a specific notification from the data subject, of a prima facie flagrant and clearly discernible infringement of the law. Those principles also apply where the search engine is used solely to search for images, given that the relevant interests involved are comparable.</p>

The question therefore arises as to whether it was for the applicants in the main proceedings to prove the alleged inaccuracy of those assertions or, at the very least, to furnish a certain degree of evidence of that inaccuracy or whether, on the contrary, Google ought either to have presumed that the claims of the applicants in the main proceedings were accurate or to have sought to clarify the facts itself.</p>

It is true that, in so far as it has no relationship with the content provider, the data subject could encounter the same difficulties as the operator of the search in making contact with the content provider. However, the data subject knows whether the referenced content is accurate or not.

However, in so far as the list of results of an image search displays only thumbnails, without reproducing information regarding the context of that publication on the third party’s internet page, that list is, in itself, neutral and does not make it possible to ascertain the context surrounding the original publication.</p>

However, in connection with the 4 June 2015 article published on the g-net website, the photographs play an important role in substantiating the message contained in that article, which is that the applicants in the main proceedings, by virtue of their position as founders and managers of the fourth company and of the group of companies referred to in paragraph 15 of the present judgment, enjoy a high standard of living and possess luxury goods, whilst the employees, distributors and customers of those companies are uncertain as to the safety of the investments made. Consequently, if account ought to be taken of the context in which those photographs were initially published, their publication as thumbnails in the list of results would have to be regarded as justified, provided that the text accompanying them is itself lawful.</p>

Similarly, it is well known that the informed average user of an image search engine is aware of the fact that the thumbnails brought together by the search engine in a list of results are taken from third party publications and that the photographs corresponding to those thumbnails are displayed, in those publications, in a particular context.</p>

If that display were retained, the practical effect of de-referencing the article would be compromised since internet users would continue to have access to the entire article, by virtue of the link contained in the thumbnails which leads to the internet page on which the article from which the thumbnails are taken is published.</p>
