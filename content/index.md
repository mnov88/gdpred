title: Welcome to the GDPR vault!

In the beginning there was a word, and the word was 'data'. Then came the EU, which decided that it did not like that one bit, and made it all _personal_.

We were thus bestowed with Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the [here it comes] protection of natural persons [nearly there] with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC... You may now take a moment to recover your breath.

The Court of Justice of the European Union — a hall of perpetually disappointed grandparents in costume — decided that they did not like it, either. This presented no obstacle whatsoever, as they've been quietly amending reality through footnotes since before most member states had indoor plumbing. They began issuing rulings that soon blanketed Europe like legal confetti. These scrolls of wisdom were sadly as unclear as the legislation they were meant to clarify, giving everyone involved the kind of headache usually reserved for tax audits.

CourtDPR exists because finding your way through this legal labyrinth should not require a team of specialists, three wizards, and a compass blessed by bureaucratic saints. Nor should it be more challenging than herding cats on a unicycle. I have gathered every GDPR judgment in one place, meticulously indexed by article, topic, and date. You can trace connections between cases, follow the breadcrumb trail from one ruling to related ones, and see which articles the Court seems particularly fond of quoting at 3 AM meetings.

**DISCLAIMER: CourtDPR is an unofficial repository created by a person who believes that legal texts should be accessible without causing immediate migraines. All judgments link to official CJEU sources. Any errors are mine alone and not the fault of the Court, which has enough to worry about already, what with the complexity of determining when a cookie actually requires consent and whether fining a company the GDP of a small nation is proportionate (or if they should have gone for a medium-sized nation instead.)**
