My approach was to:

1. Group similar topics under logical categories while maintaining distinct legal concepts
2. Eliminate redundancies where the same case was referenced for nearly identical topics
3. Preserve all case references to ensure no information is lost
4. Use lowercase for terms except where proper nouns are required

This reorganization maintains all the essential information while making the list more navigable for a data protection officer. I've reduced the length to approximately one-third of the original while preserving each case and its relevant context.
