 

 In the beginning, there was a word, and the word was 'data'. Then came the EU, which decided that it did not like that one bit, and made it _personal_. We were thus bestowed with *Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the* [here it comes] *protection of natural persons* [nearly there] *with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC*.
 
 The Court of Justice of the European Union — a hall of perpetually disappointed grandparents in costume — decided that they did not like it, either. This presented no obstacle whatsoever, as they've been quietly amending reality through footnotes since before most Member States had indoor plumbing. The Court thus began issuing rulings that touched upon any issue imaginable, with all the warmth and joy of a surprise tax audit.

These scrolls of wisdom were unfortunately written in a language which can only charitably be described as 'impenetrable'.

"In that regard, it is apparent from an analysis of the different language versions of the first sentence of [[Article 82]](2\) of the GDPR that the controller is presumed to have participated in the processing that constitutes the infringement of that regulation referred to. While the German, French and Finnish language versions are worded in an open manner, a number of other language versions are more precise and use a demonstrative determiner for the third occurrence of the term 'processing', or for the third reference to that term, with the result that it is clear that that third occurrence or reference refers to the same operation as the second occurrence of that term."

It is at this point your average person sighs, rubs their temples, and mutters something about 'a high level of protection for natural persons in their data' before reaching for the extra-strength aspirin.

 This website exists because finding your way through this legal labyrinth should not require a herd of cats on a unicycle, three wizards, and a compass blessed by bureaucratic saints. I have gathered every GDPR judgment in one place, indexed by article, topic, and date. You can trace connections between cases, follow the breadcrumb trail from one ruling to related ones, and see which articles the Court keeps muttering about in its sleep. No simplification, just the kind of organization that brings tears of joy to the eyes of librarians and mild panic to those who profit from legal confusion.
