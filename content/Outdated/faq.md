## Website FAQ

<div class="faq-container">
  <div class="faq-item">
    <div class="faq-question">How current is this information?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      <p>Updated more regularly than the Court's understanding of technology. Which is to say: frequently, but always one step behind.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="faq-item">
    <div class="faq-question">Found a mistake?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      <p>I've made an error somewhere in this maze? Impossible!¹ Please inform me of this reality breach via the contact form at <a href="https://milos.no/#contact">milos.no</a>, or drop me a message on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/milosnovovic/">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
      <p>¹Actually quite possible, probable even.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="faq-item">
    <div class="faq-question">Feature request</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      <p>Had a brilliant idea? I'd love to hear it! (See contact info above.) All reasonable ideas (and even some of the unreasonable ones) will be considered.</p>
      <p><em>Implementation subject to time constraints and the mysterious behavior of code when I press random keys while hoping for the best.</em></p>
      <p>(And yes, I have considered adding free AI summaries. I am just scared people would take them too seriously. But we'll see.)</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="faq-item">
    <div class="faq-question">Why do this?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      <p>An excellent question, and one my therapist asks frequently.</p>
      <p>The short answer involves a peculiar fondness for legal reasoning and a deep love for sparking nerdy conversations. For a longer one, feel free to do some casual stalking on Google (or, God forbid, Bing) -- or, you know, drop me a line.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="faq-item">
    <div class="faq-question">Is this legal advice?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      <p>This site offers the same legal authority as your neighbor's cousin who once read a book about law while waiting at the dentist. Which is to say: <em>none whatsoever</em>.</p>
      <p>If you require actual legal counsel, please consult a professional who charges by the hour and has the appropriate certificates displayed at slightly crooked angles on their office wall.</p>
      <p><em>However</em>, I do have a separate professional life where I put on my serious face and provide legitimate advice. Get in touch (you know this by now) via <a href="https://milos.no/#contact">milos.no</a> or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/milosnovovic/">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
      <p>Or ask me to put my serious face on.</p>
