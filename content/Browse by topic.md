> [!Danger] **WARNING**
> This list is very, *very* much a work in progress. It merely tries to systematize *the Court's own* tagging of the cases, which is notoriously incomplete (see it in its full glory here: [[Case law by CJEU-topics]]). I will update the list to a more meaningful one; if you want to help (or have one already), drop me a line!
