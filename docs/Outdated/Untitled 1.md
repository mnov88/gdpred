FAQ



**How current is this information?**

Updated more regularly than the Court's understanding of technology. Which is to say: frequently, but always one step behind.

**Found a mistake?**

I've made an error somewhere in this maze? Impossible!¹ Please inform me of this reality breach via the contact form at www.milos.no, or drop me a message on LinkedIn  https://www.linkedin.com/in/milosnovovic/ .

¹Actually quite possible, probable even.

**Feature request**

Had a brilliant idea? I'd love to hear it! (See contact info above.) All reasonable ideas (and even some of the unreasonable ones) will be considered.

*Implementation subject to time constraints and the mysterious behavior of code when I press random keys while hoping for the best.*

(And yes, I have considered adding free AI summaries. I am just scared people would take them too seriously. But we'll see.)

**Why do this?**

An excellent question, and one my therapist asks frequently. 

The short answer involves a peculiar fondness for legal reasoning and a deep love for sparking nerdy conversations. For a longer one, feel free to do some casual stalking on Google (or, God forbid, Bing) -- or, you know, drop me a line.

**Is this legal advice?**

This site offers the same legal authority as your neighbor's cousin who once read a book about law while waiting at the dentist. Which is to say: *none whatsoever*.

If you require actual legal counsel, please consult a professional who charges by the hour and has the appropriate certificates displayed at slightly crooked angles on their office wall. 

_However_, I do have a separate professional life where I put on my serious face and provide legitimate advice. Get in touch (you know this by now) via https://milos.no/#contact or https://www.linkedin.com/in/milosnovovic/ LinkedIn.

Or ask me to put my serious face on.
