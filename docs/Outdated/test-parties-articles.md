# Test Parties and Articles

This page demonstrates both the parties component and the ruling-articles component.

## Parties Component

The parties component displays the text from the `parties` frontmatter entry as a subtitle directly beneath the article title. This is useful for legal documents where you want to show the involved parties prominently.

## Ruling Articles Component

The ruling-articles component displays a list of articles from the `ruling-articles` frontmatter entry as chips beneath the parties subtitle. This is useful for showing which legal articles are relevant to the document.
