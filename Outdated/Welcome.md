# Welcome to GDPRed!

Welcome to **GDPRed**, where we've transformed the impenetrable jungle of data protection rulings into something vaguely resembling navigable terrain. You've entered a dangerous realm where, instead of dragons, the Court of Justice of the European Union — a hall of perpetually disappointed grandparents in costume — has spent decades ensuring that clarity remains theoretical and brevity is punishable by 174 additional paragraphs.

"*But what about Case C-40/17?*" you ask innocently. "*Ah yes*," replies the Court with a benevolent smile, adjusting its robes, "*that's on page 47, paragraph 92, which refers you to Article 4(7), which is best understood through the lens of Case C-210/16, which cannot be comprehended without first reading Articles 5, 13, and 73(c), which naturally lead back to Case C-40/17. Was that not perfectly clear?*"

It is at this point your average person sighs, rubs their temples, and mutters something about 'a high level of protection for natural persons in their data' before reaching for the extra-strength aspirin.

 This website exists because finding your way through this legal labyrinth should not require a herd of cats on a unicycle, three wizards, and a compass blessed by bureaucratic saints. I have gathered every GDPR judgment in one place, indexed by article, topic, and date. You can trace connections between cases, follow the breadcrumb trail from one ruling to related ones, and see which articles the Court keeps muttering about in its sleep. No simplification, just the kind of organization that brings tears of joy to the eyes of librarians and mild panic to those who profit from legal confusion. 

DISCLAIMER: This website is for informational purposes only, much like how the CJEU's 200-page rulings are "for clarity." While we've done our utmost to map this legal labyrinth, we cannot guarantee that the Court hasn't, since yesterday, invented seven new principles, referenced three non-existent articles, or decided that the entire GDPR should now be interpreted through the lens of 17th-century maritime law. Always consult official sources, preferably with adequate provisions of caffeine and sanity breaks.

 **DISCLAIMER: CourtDPR is an unofficial repository created by a person who believes that legal texts should be accessible without causing immediate migraines. All judgments link to official CJEU sources. Any errors are mine alone and not the fault of the Court, which has enough to worry about already, what with the complexity of determining when a cookie actually requires consent and whether fining a company the GDP of a small nation is proportionate (or if they should have gone for a medium-sized nation instead.)**
