# Test Now Reading Component

This is a test file to see our new "Now Reading" component in action.

## What is this component?

The "Now Reading" component is a proof of concept that displays:
1. The text "Now Reading:"
2. The title of the current page (from frontmatter)
3. Additional metadata from frontmatter such as author, date, and tags

It serves as a visual indicator of what content the user is currently viewing, with enhanced metadata display.
