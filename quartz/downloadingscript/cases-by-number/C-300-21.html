As regards the claim for compensation, that court referred to recitals 75, 85 and 146 of the GDPR and held that the Member States’ provisions of national law on civil liability supplement the provisions of that regulation, in so far as the latter does not contain special rules. In that regard, it noted that, under Austrian law, a breach of the rules on the protection of personal data is not automatically associated with non-material damage and gives rise to a right to compensation only where such damage reaches a certain ‘threshold of seriousness’.

It argues that the award of such compensation is subject to proof of specific damage distinct from that breach, which does not in itself establish the existence of non-material damage. In its view, recital 75 of that regulation refers to the mere possibility that non-material damage may result from the breaches listed therein and, although recital 85 refers to the risk of a ‘loss of control’ of the data affected, that risk is, however, uncertain in the present case, since those data were not transmitted to a third party.</p>

In its view, any compensation due on that basis must be proportionate, effective and dissuasive, so that the damages awarded may fulfil a compensatory function, but not be punitive in nature, which is extraneous to EU law.</p>

In that regard, it notes that recital 146 of the GDPR advocates a broad interpretation of the concept of ‘damage’ within the meaning of that regulation. It takes the view that non-material damage must be compensated, under Article 82 of that regulation, if it is tangible, even if it is minor. By contrast, such damage should not be compensated if it appears to be completely negligible, as would be the case for the merely unpleasant feelings that are typically associated with such a breach.</p>

Second, recitals 75 and 85 state, respectively, that ‘the risk … may result from personal data processing which could lead to … damage’ and that a ‘personal data breach may … result in … damage’. It follows, first, that the occurrence of damage in the context of such processing is only potential; second, that an infringement of the GDPR does not necessarily result in damage, and, third, that there must be a causal link between the infringement in question and the damage suffered by the data subject in order to establish a right to compensation.</p>

That difference in wording is indicative of the importance of the ‘damage’ criterion, and therefore of its distinctive nature as against the ‘infringement’ criterion, for the purposes of claims for compensation based on the GDPR.</p>

The relationship between the rules set out in Article 82 and those set out in Articles 83 and 84 shows that there is a difference between those two categories of provisions, but also complementarity, in terms of encouraging compliance with the GDPR, it being observed that the right of any person to seek compensation for damage reinforces the operational nature of the protection rules laid down by that regulation and is likely to discourage the reoccurrence of unlawful conduct.</p>
