In circumstances such as those set out in paragraph 76 above, such a controller must also ensure that the telephone service operator that has communicated those personal data to it is informed so that that operator amends the list of personal data that it automatically forwards to that provider of directories and keeps separate the data of its subscribers who have indicated their wish to withdraw their consent to those data being made public.</p>

Furthermore, as the Advocate General stated in point 68 of his Opinion, it also forms part of the requirement laid down in Article 12(2) of the GDPR, pursuant to which the controller must facilitate the exercise of the rights conferred on the data subject, inter alia, by Article 17 of that regulation.</p>
