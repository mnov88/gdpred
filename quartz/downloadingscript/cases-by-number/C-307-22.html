However, the wording of Article 15 of that regulation does not make exercise of the right to communication subject to the existence of such grounds.

In this instance, FT is relying on the objective of protecting the rights and freedoms of others which is set out in Article 23(1)(i) of the GDPR and argues that the charging system introduced by the second sentence of subparagraph 2 of Paragraph 630g of the BGB is a measure which (i) is necessary and proportionate to safeguard the legitimate interests of persons providing treatment and (ii) as a general rule, contributes to preventing requests for copies by the patients concerned which do not contain a statement of reasons.</p>

It is therefore necessary to determine whether the interest of those persons in being relieved of the costs and charges connected with providing copies of data is included in the rights and freedoms of others for the purposes of Article 23(1)(i) of the GDPR. Furthermore, the systematic transfer to patients of the costs connected with copies of their medical records could appear excessive, given that it does not take account either of the amount of costs actually incurred or of the circumstances specific to each request.</p>

In that regard, that right could be complied with through the communication of a summary of the data processed by the medical professional. However, it appears that the objectives of transparency and verifying lawfulness pursued by the GDPR argue in favour of communicating a copy of all the data available to the controller in their original form, namely all the medical documents concerning the patient inasmuch as they contain such data.</p>
