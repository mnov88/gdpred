      <p class="oj-normal">Due to the circumstances of its creation, its composition, and the powers conferred upon it, the Disciplinary Chamber of the Supreme Court does not constitute a judicial body that displays the characteristics of an independent tribunal within the meaning of Article 19(1) TEU, read in conjunction with Article 47 of the Charter. As a result, maintaining its jurisdiction in cases relating to other national judges, concerning the status of judges and the conditions under which the office of judge is to be exercised, infringes their independence, and is in breach of Article 19(1) TEU.</p>
      <p class="oj-normal">The amending law of 20 December 2019, by excluding the possibility for national courts to review compliance, by panels of judges ruling in cases concerning EU law, with the requirements of being an independent and impartial tribunal previously established by law within the meaning of Article 19(1) TEU, read in conjunction with Article 47 of the Charter, infringes those provisions and disregards the mechanism for referring questions for a preliminary ruling provided for in Article 267 TFEU. This is because, according to the case-law of the Court of Justice, national courts are under an obligation to ensure that cases concerning rights which individuals derive from EU law are examined by an independent and impartial tribunal previously established by law. The classification of such a review as having the characteristics of a disciplinary offence is also in breach of EU law. Every national court, when adjudicating on EU law, must have the possibility to assess, of its own motion or at the request of a party, whether cases concerning EU law are examined by an independent tribunal within the meaning of EU law, without the threat of disciplinary proceedings being initiated in respect of the judges concerned. Conferring exclusive jurisdiction in relation to the examination of requests for the recusal of a judge from a particular case, or for the determination of an appropriate panel to rule on that case, based on an allegation of lack of independence of a judge or panel, on the Extraordinary Review and Public Affairs Chamber of the Supreme Court prevents other national courts from fulfilling the obligations mentioned above and from referring questions concerning the interpretation of that EU requirement to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling. Conversely, according to the case-law of the Court of Justice, every national court is entitled to refer questions for a preliminary ruling under Article 267 TFEU. Moreover, courts whose decisions are not subject to appeal are obliged to do so in the event of any issues of interpretation.</p>
      <p class="oj-normal">Obliging every judge to supply, within 30 days from his or her appointment to the office of judge, information regarding his or her membership of a professional body or association, the functions performed by him or her within non-commercial foundations, and his or her membership of a political party, as well as publishing that information in the Biuletyn Informacji Publicznej (Public Information Bulletin) before his or her appointment to the office of judge infringes a judge’s fundamental right to respect for his or her private life and to the protection of his or her personal data, and is in breach of the provisions of the GDPR.</p>
