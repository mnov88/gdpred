Despite a request made to that end by the referring court, the Federal Office did not produce a complete record of the processing activities relating to that file. Such a record should have been compiled at the time of the processing of the personal data relating to the applicant in the main proceedings, namely the date on which he lodged his application for international protection. The Federal Office should be heard on the issue of its accountability, under Article 5(2) of the GDPR, after the Court has ruled on the present request for a preliminary ruling.</p>

            <p class="coj-normal">Second, as regards the transmission of the electronic file via the Electronic Court and Administration Mailbox, such transmission constitutes ‘processing’ of data, within the meaning of Article 4(2) of the GDPR, which must comply with the principles laid down in Article 5 of that regulation. However, in disregard of Article 26 of that regulation, no national legislation governs that procedure for transmission between the administrative authorities and the courts by defining the respective responsibilities of the joint controllers and no arrangement to that effect has been produced by the Federal Office, despite a request to that effect made by the referring court. The latter thus raises the question of the lawfulness of that transfer of data via the Electronic Court and Administration Mailbox.</p>

            <p class="coj-normal">In particular, according to the referring court, it is necessary to determine whether the disregard of the obligations laid down in Articles 5, 26 and 30 of the GDPR from which the unlawful processing of personal data allegedly stems must be penalised by the erasure of those data, in accordance with Article 17(1)(d) of that regulation, or by a restriction of processing, in accordance with Article 18(1)(b) of that regulation. Such penalties must at least be envisaged in the case of a request by the data subject. Otherwise, that court would be obliged to participate in unlawful processing of those data in the context of the judicial proceedings. In such a case, only the supervisory authority would be able to intervene, pursuant to Article 58 of the GDPR, by imposing an administrative fine on the public authorities concerned, pursuant to Article 83(5)(a) of that regulation. However, in accordance with Article 43(3) of the BDSG, which transposes Article 83(7) of that regulation, no administrative fine may be imposed at national level on public authorities and other public bodies. It follows that neither Directive 2013/32 nor the GDPR has been complied with.</p>

It is true that, in the present case, the data are used by the Federal Office to comply, in accordance with Article 17(3)(b) of that regulation, with a legal obligation which requires processing by EU or Member State law to which the controller is subject or for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller.

            <p class="coj-normal">The referring court is therefore uncertain as to what extent it may, in the context of its judicial activity, take into account the personal data provided in the context of such a procedure which is attributable to the executive. If the maintenance of the electronic file or its transmission via the Electronic Court and Administration Mailbox were to be classified as unlawful processing under the GDPR, that court would, by taking such data into account, participate in the unlawful processing at issue, which would run counter to the objective pursued by that regulation, which is to protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons, and in particular their right to the protection of personal data.</p>

If that court were unable to take into account the data contained in the electronic ‘MARIS’ file on account of the illegalities vitiating the maintenance and transmission of that file, there would be no legal basis, pending any rectification of those illegalities, for the purpose of taking a decision on the application of the applicant in the main proceedings for the grant of refugee status.

First of all, it is apparent from the order for reference that the disregard, by the Federal Office, of Article 5(2) of the GDPR has not been definitively established, the referring court merely presuming this to be the case. Next, that court did not state that the files of the Federal Office, on the assumption that it is not authorised to use them, are alone decisive for the solution of this dispute It also has other sources of information, which, in accordance with the principle of ex officio investigation, should be fully exploited where an authority does not submit files or where those files are incomplete. Lastly, the third question is manifestly hypothetical, since it is not apparent from the order for reference that the applicant in the main proceedings consented to or consents to the use of the processing of his personal data by the referring court.</p>

It is sufficient to note, in that regard, that Article 83(7) of that regulation expressly confers on Member States the power to provide whether and to what extent such fines may be imposed on public authorities or bodies.
