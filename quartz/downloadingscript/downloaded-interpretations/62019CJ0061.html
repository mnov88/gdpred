The request further states that although not specified in the contracts at issue in the main proceedings, Orange România agreed to conclude those contracts with customers who refused to consent to a copy of their identity document being stored, and at the same time required in that case that those customers sign a specific form setting out their refusal.</p>

As the Advocate General observed in point 45 of his Opinion, the fact that those customers signed the contracts containing the ticked box does not, on its own, prove such consent, in the absence of any indications confirming that that clause was actually read and digested. It is for the referring court to carry out the necessary investigations to that end.</p>

As the Commission observed at the hearing, such an additional requirement is liable to affect unduly the freedom to choose to object to that collection and storage, which it is also for the referring court to determine.</p>
