The wording ‘given his or her consent’ does, however, lend itself to a literal interpretation according to which action is required on the part of the user in order to give his or her consent. In that regard, it is clear from recital 17 of Directive 2002/58 that, for the purposes of that directive, a user’s consent may be given by any appropriate method enabling a freely given specific and informed indication of the user’s wishes, including ‘by ticking a box when visiting an internet website’.</p>

Recital 17 of Directive 2002/58 states that, for the purposes of that directive, consent of a user should have the same meaning as the data subject’s consent as defined and further specified in Directive 95/46.</p>

Directive 2009/136 introduced a substantive amendment to the wording of that provision, by replacing that wording with ‘given his or her consent’.
