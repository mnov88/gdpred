It takes the view that the personal data contained in a declaration of private interests are liable to reveal information on the private life of the declarant and his or her spouse and of the declarant’s children, with the result that their disclosure is capable of infringing the right of the data subjects to respect for their private life. Indeed, those data are liable to reveal particularly sensitive information, such as the fact that the data subject is cohabiting or is living with another person of the same sex, the disclosure of which might well result in significant nuisance in the private life of those persons. The data concerning presents received and transactions carried out, by the declarant and his or her spouse, cohabitee or partner, also reveal certain details of their private life. Moreover, the data concerning close relatives or acquaintances of the declarant who may give rise to a conflict of interests reveal information about the declarant’s family and personal relationships.</p>
