During their conversation, X noted that that journalist had at his disposal documents from the case file concerned – including documents that he himself had drafted – showing his name and address in particular as well as Z’s national identification number. That journalist told him that those documents had been made available to him under the right of access to the case file which the Administrative Jurisdiction Division of the Raad van State (Council of State) grants to journalists.</p>

It follows that, subject to the cases mentioned in Article 2(2) and (3) thereof, Regulation 2016/679 applies to processing operations carried out both by private persons and by public authorities, including, as recital 20 thereof indicates, judicial authorities, such as courts.</p>
