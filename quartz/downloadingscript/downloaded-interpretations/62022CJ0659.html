The application scans the QR code of the certificate using the camera of the mobile telephone of the person conducting the check. That person then has a preview of the basic identifying data of the certificate holder (surname, first name and date of birth) as well as the status (valid or invalid) of the certificate. By clicking on a specific button of the application, the person conducting the check is able to access the complete set of the information shown in the certificate, such as vaccination, type of vaccine, vaccine manufacturer, number of doses received, date of vaccination, date of first positive result and certificate issuer. The ‘čTečka’ application merely temporarily displays those data on the screen of the mobile telephone of the person conducting the check, so that those data are not retained or sent anywhere.</p>

At the time when the application is installed on the mobile telephone of the person conducting the check, a text is displayed stating that ‘the “čTečka” application is operated in accordance with EU law and the law of the Czech Republic and facilitates the free movement of persons and access to services and events during the COVID-19 pandemic. The application processes personal data of the holders of the COVID digital certificates of the Member States of the European Union for the purpose of checks conducted by persons empowered to do so under EU rules, extraordinary measures [of the Ministry] or on a voluntary basis.

In order to be able to assess whether or not the certificate is valid and determine whether the ‘infection-free’ conditions provided for by the extraordinary measure are satisfied by the data subject, the application must necessarily compare the health-related information of that person, such as the date of vaccination, with the validation rules in force at the material time.</p>
