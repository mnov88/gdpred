On the other hand, in contrast to that provision, the wording of Article 58(2)(d) and (g) of the regulation does not permit the inference that action by the supervisory authority of a Member State, in order to apply the measures referred to therein, is confined solely to situations where the data subject has made a request to that end, since that wording makes no reference to such a request.</p>
